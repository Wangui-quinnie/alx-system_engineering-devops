Building on what you did in the previous tasks, let’s expand our web application by adding another service for Gunicorn to handle. In AirBnB_clone_v2/web_flask/6-number_odd_or_even, the route /number_odd_or_even/<int:n> should already be defined to render a page telling you whether an integer is odd or even. You’ll need to configure Nginx to proxy HTTP requests to the route /airbnb-dynamic/number_odd_or_even/(any integer) to a Gunicorn instance listening on port 5001. The key to this exercise is getting Nginx configured to proxy requests to processes listening on two different ports. You are not expected to keep your application server processes running. If you want to know how to run multiple instances of Gunicorn without having multiple terminals open, see tips below.
